                Starting with v2.91.6 device provisioning will not start if the
                device

                was unable to register in the cloud due to lack of internet connectivity.

                To avoid this, we switch to retrying 3 times with the usual 2 second delay

                between attempts, after which the flashing process will start.

                Let's ensure tools like fixdep are built in container
                and not reused from the yocto build, otherwise they
                may not run if they were linked against a different
                version of libc that may not be available in the kernel
                modules build container.

                This fixes the following error encountered when doing
                a Poky Honister build for the balena-intel repository:

              hash: fb171dc507348e11ab2c6ed894289f51689fc874

                This was originally introduced in combination with a kernel
                patch backported

                from Red Hat kernel that would enable kernel lockdown when secure boot

                is enabled. We have since changed the approach, dropped the kernel patch

                and when in secure boot mode use a different GRUB config file that enables

                lockdown on kernel command line unconditionally.


                That said, while the patch works fine, we do not really need it and it adds

                extra overhead porting it to newer yocto versions so there is no point keeping

                it at this moment. If in the future there is need for the kernel to know

                whether it is in secure boot mode or not, we can roll this back and rebase.

                In most cases there is not enough space on rootfs to extract

                and load a local hostapp image when the balena-host tmpdir

                is on the same partition.


                This uses a data mount to ensure temporary extracted files of the

                compressed image will not fill the target sysroot.

                Should this happen, we use sgdisk to check and recover the end gpt

                Since
                https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/1eee36a5520b5a89fb4d0d6af6f9cb0217a3164f

                was merged and included in kernel versions after 5.10.84,

                building the kernel-modules-headers fails due to various missing

                headers from the gmp and mpc packages. This problem is visible

                only after upgrading to a newer kernel, because until now the

                gcc plugins kernel config was not enabled at all, due to the

                failed check in the above mentioned patch.


                Since we are not using the functions provided

                by the gcc plugins anyway, we can disable this

                config.

                In the current state the by-state symlink for balena-efi
                partition

                is not generated for two reasons:

                - 60-resin-update-state.rules only react to resin-* partition names

                - the root device is not identified correctly in resin_update_state_probe
                  for LUKS devices

                This patch fixes both the issues and makes use of the by-state symlink

                instead of by-label.

                This patch adds the check for PCRs

                - 0 - firmware/UEFI blob

                - 1 - firmware/UEFI config

                - 2 - Expansion card firmware blobs

                - 3 - Expansion card firmware configs


                The full protection is only applied on first boot after provisioning,

                flasher only locks against PCRs 0, 2 and 3.

                This is because when using flasher, the environment is not in the same

                state as the one we want to lock to. In particular the boot order is

                different (flasher is booted from a different drive than the resulting OS).

                As for now we were not able to find a better solution than fully locking

                only on first boot. This means the device must be booted in a secure

                environment at least once after provisioning.

                        The moby engine v20.x.y adds some selinux [security
                        configurations](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration)

                        depending on the [container configuration](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/daemon/create.go#L214).

                        This would cause the supervisor to enter a service restart loop as the

                        current and target service configurations will never match. The

                        supervisor now ignores selinux specific security options since those are

                        not supported by balenaOS.

                        previously switch would treat S_IFIFO and S_IFSOCK as
                        the same, passing

                        both of the to mkfifo, which lead to EINVAL errors when trying to create

                        the socket, we instead handle socket separately.


                        Also adds cases for this to the unit and integration tests of the

                        migrator.

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads
                        after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                        If the engine process is terminated during the layer
                        extraction transaction,

                        before Commit or Cancel is called on the transaction, a new FS layer can be created

                        by the graph driver without any link to the layers metadata.


                        This change ensures we don't perform any actions on the graph driver storage until

                        the FS layer ID (the cacheID) is  persisted as a part of the transaction data.


                        We can use this data to clean up the graph driver storage on next process start

                        deleting all data associated with the transactions terminated abruptly.

                The prepare-openvpn service needs to be restarted to regenerate
                the

                VPN keys when provisioning is finished and the `apiKey` is removed.


                Note that flasher images make changes to `/mnt/boottmp/config.json` so

                we still need to manually kick `prepare-openvpn` in

                `resin-device-register`, which is preferable to modifying services to

                watch multiple paths.

                This might also resolve a race condition that has been difficult to

                Upstream kernel added a new fkms overlay for
                the Pi4 and CM4 and switched to using it
                from overlay-map, however, we were not aware
                of this.

                Let's add a vcdbg testcase to warn in case the RPi
                firmware fails to load any overlay or dtb, and set
                gpu_mem to 64 so that vcdbg can run.

              hash: 13cf7c9fef0a6e0df6b042ba34ceaa7a0d005254
              body: >
                We want the VPN to start unconditionally even if the
                connectivity URL

                is not reachable.


                The rationale for adding the dependency in the first place was that

                without an initial timesync certificate checks may fail. This can still

                happen, but the VPN will retry continuously and eventually succeed once

                the time is synched.


                What happens now is that the VPN is delayed until the http sync, so if

                the connectivity URL is blocked or unreachable, but the internet is

                accessible, VPN will not even launch and no remote debugging is possible.

                on config.json changes are part of this target.


                This causes a burst of service restarts each time config.json changes,

                independently of whether the configuration changes applies to the unit

                or not.


                This commit removes all config-json.target instances in preparation for

                the introduction of a better, more fine grained mechanism.

                We add this this check since we discovered
                that with newer boot firmware the Pi4 will
                not reboot when under-voltage is reported.

                We don't mark the test as failed in
                this case, since there may be devices that
                continue to work even if under-powered and we
                don't want to block or delay development if the
                DUT is remote and cannot be checked or replaced
                easily.

                This check provides an indication for further
                debugging of failed test cases.

                After moving the partition resizing code to execute on each
                boot,

                we made it unreachable on first boot. We must not exit the script

                after resizing the partition only because that way the resizing

                is only finished on 2nd boot.

                When resizing the filesystem fails, such as when resize2fs won't
                touch

                it because it's dirty, the partition gets resized, but not the

                filesystem. The script will not attempt to resize the filesystem again,

                as it detects the partition has already been resized.


                Split these actions apart, so that the filesystem resize is always

                attempted. If resize2fs detects that the filesystem is already filling

                available space, it will exit with no action taken.
