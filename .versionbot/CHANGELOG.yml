                        The moby engine v20.x.y adds some selinux [security
                        configurations](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#security-configuration)

                        depending on the [container configuration](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/daemon/create.go#L214).

                        This would cause the supervisor to enter a service restart loop as the

                        current and target service configurations will never match. The

                        supervisor now ignores selinux specific security options since those are

                        not supported by balenaOS.

                        previously switch would treat S_IFIFO and S_IFSOCK as
                        the same, passing

                        both of the to mkfifo, which lead to EINVAL errors when trying to create

                        the socket, we instead handle socket separately.


                        Also adds cases for this to the unit and integration tests of the

                        migrator.

                        This commit changes the way we retry layer downloads
                        after failures with

                        the goal of making it more resilient, especially for cases involving

                        large layers and unreliable network connections.


                        These are the changes:


                        * Make sure we also retry after failures in `v2LayerDescriptor.reset()`.
                          This method creates a new HTTP request to resume a failed download,
                          and therefore depends on a working network to succeed.
                        * Wait exponentially longer times between retries (instead of retrying
                          immediately as before). This shall increase of success in case of
                          network issues that take longer to get resolved.
                        * Increase the number of retries to 10.

                        * Reset retry count whenever we successfully download anything at all.
                          The idea is that we want to give up downloading only after a long
                          continuous period of failures. Combined with the exponential back-off
                          strategy and increased number of retries described above, a layer pull
                          will fail only after about 17 minutes.
                        * Add a bit more logging to help with troubleshooting.

                        disabled,

                        so features like `-ef` and providing pids via `-q` are not

                        supported. Add a 3rd condition to try ps with no args and allow

                        parsePSOutput to filter by pid.

                        If the engine process is terminated during the layer
                        extraction transaction,

                        before Commit or Cancel is called on the transaction, a new FS layer can be created

                        by the graph driver without any link to the layers metadata.


                        This change ensures we don't perform any actions on the graph driver storage until

                        the FS layer ID (the cacheID) is  persisted as a part of the transaction data.


                        We can use this data to clean up the graph driver storage on next process start

                        deleting all data associated with the transactions terminated abruptly.

                        support for them once we move to the new balenaCI-based pipeline.

                The prepare-openvpn service needs to be restarted to regenerate
                the

                VPN keys when provisioning is finished and the `apiKey` is removed.


                Note that flasher images make changes to `/mnt/boottmp/config.json` so

                we still need to manually kick `prepare-openvpn` in

                `resin-device-register`, which is preferable to modifying services to

                watch multiple paths.

                This might also resolve a race condition that has been difficult to

                track down.

                Upstream kernel added a new fkms overlay for
                the Pi4 and CM4 and switched to using it
                from overlay-map, however, we were not aware
                of this.

                Let's add a vcdbg testcase to warn in case the RPi
                firmware fails to load any overlay or dtb, and set
                gpu_mem to 64 so that vcdbg can run.

              hash: 13cf7c9fef0a6e0df6b042ba34ceaa7a0d005254
              body: >
                We want the VPN to start unconditionally even if the
                connectivity URL

                is not reachable.


                The rationale for adding the dependency in the first place was that

                without an initial timesync certificate checks may fail. This can still

                happen, but the VPN will retry continuously and eventually succeed once

                the time is synched.


                What happens now is that the VPN is delayed until the http sync, so if

                the connectivity URL is blocked or unreachable, but the internet is

                accessible, VPN will not even launch and no remote debugging is possible.


                Fixes #2508

                on config.json changes are part of this target.


                This causes a burst of service restarts each time config.json changes,

                independently of whether the configuration changes applies to the unit

                or not.


                This commit removes all config-json.target instances in preparation for

                the introduction of a better, more fine grained mechanism.

                unlock all the partitions, find the real kernel and kexec into it.

                We add this this check since we discovered
                that with newer boot firmware the Pi4 will
                not reboot when under-voltage is reported.

                We don't mark the test as failed in
                this case, since there may be devices that
                continue to work even if under-powered and we
                don't want to block or delay development if the
                DUT is remote and cannot be checked or replaced
                easily.

                This check provides an indication for further
                debugging of failed test cases.

                This will allow us to refer to the supervisor image by the repo
                name

                in docker commands, like docker inspect, and prevent re-downloading the

                image even though it already exists as an untagged digest.

                When resizing the filesystem fails, such as when resize2fs won't
                touch

                it because it's dirty, the partition gets resized, but not the

                filesystem. The script will not attempt to resize the filesystem again,

                as it detects the partition has already been resized.


                Split these actions apart, so that the filesystem resize is always

                attempted. If resize2fs detects that the filesystem is already filling

                available space, it will exit with no action taken.
